# A repository of Data Science and Machine Learning Projects
Author: Spandhana Gonuguntla

Datasets are from the textbook **"An Introduction to Statistical Learning"**, downloaded from https://www.statlearning.com/, and they are also available in this repository in the folder named 'Datasets'.

This repository contains an exploration of various machine learning models.
